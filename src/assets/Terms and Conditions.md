## **1\. Introduction**

These Terms and Conditions govern the provision of digitisation and related services by *White Gloves Studio* (“we”, “us”, or “our”) to the client (“you” or “your”). By engaging our services, you agree to these Terms.

## **2\. Services Provided**

We offer professional digitisation services, with a focus on conservation-grade handling and processing of physical materials. Services may include scanning, image enhancement, digital file preparation, metadata tagging, and basic conservation advice.

A detailed scope of work will be agreed upon prior to commencement of services.

You agree to:

* Provide materials in a safe, clean, and legal condition.

* Clearly communicate any sensitivities, fragility, or value associated with the items.

* Provide accurate contact and delivery information.

You warrant that you own or have the legal right to submit all materials for digitisation.

## **4\. Handling of Materials**

We apply a conservation-informed approach and take all reasonable care with client materials. However, due to the nature of historical or fragile items, we do not accept liability for degradation, damage, or loss that arises from inherent fragility, pre-existing condition, or transit.

Clients are encouraged to notify us of any special handling requirements before submission.

## **5\. Digital Files**

We will provide you with high-resolution digital files in the agreed format. Unless otherwise agreed:

* Files will be delivered via secure download link or external storage device.

* We do not store or use your files beyond the agreed service period without your consent.

## **6\. Payment Terms**

* A full quote will be provided prior to commencement.

* Payment is due in full upon project completion unless otherwise arranged.

* Accepted payment methods include bank transfer, card payment, or invoicing via \[insert payment platform\].

* Late payments may incur an administrative fee of \[$X\] after 14 days.

## **7\. Cancellations and Refunds**

* You may cancel your booking at any time before the project commences.

* For cancellations after work has begun, you may be charged for work completed to date.

* Refunds are not issued once digital files have been delivered, except in the case of service error or breach.

## **8\. Turnaround Time**

Estimated delivery timelines will be provided upon booking. While we strive to meet deadlines, timelines may vary depending on material complexity and volume. Delays caused by force majeure or unforeseen circumstances are not grounds for penalty.

## **9\. Confidentiality and Privacy**

We respect your privacy and manage all personal information and digital content in accordance with our Privacy Policy. We do not share, publish, or reproduce your materials without explicit written consent.

## **10\. Intellectual Property**

You retain ownership of your original materials and any intellectual property rights associated with them. We retain no rights to the digital files we create unless agreed in writing (e.g. for portfolio or educational use).

## **11\. Liability**

To the fullest extent permitted by law:

* We exclude all warranties except those required by law.

* Our liability is limited to re-performing the services or refunding the fee paid.

We are not liable for indirect loss, consequential damage, or loss of data once digital delivery is completed.
